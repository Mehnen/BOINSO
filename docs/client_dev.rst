Why Clients?
============

The BOINSO Mission Control Center web application is designed to offer the end user (Mission Control Center) and the different participants (Ground Control Clients) as much flexibility in client design as possible. The core web application itself is exposed through different API endpoints (callable through the browsable API or other applications). To offer a convinient start using BOINSO we also provide a web application which can be used to administer a MCC or to register as a new GCC.

Where to find it?
=================

The client web application resides at this Github repository location: BOINSO-MCC-Web-Client_
